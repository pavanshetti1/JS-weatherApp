# JS-weatherApp

<br>
JS-weatherApp is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
<br>
It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. 
The app allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 
<br>
relevant weather icon based on the weather conditions.
